# My Osu Songs Folder 1.4GB 26702 Maps

Includes All MANIA Ranked, Approved and Loved state Beatmaps. NO AUDIO &amp; PICTURES
around 2% graveyard maps.

NOTE: The Folders Only includes MANIA .osu files.

IDEA: My goal is to make it possible to have the most comprimized Songs folder fast and easy accessible with all Mania Beatmaps that have a leaderboard.

**How to set it Up?**

Note: You need to have git and osu! installed!
Create a folder on your System. Go into it. Clone my repo.
Change the name of the original Songs folder and copy the cloned Songs folder into your osu! directory. :3

**On Windows:** press win+R: Type `cmd`. Go to your folder with `cd`.If you dont know where you are, type in `dir`. Then navigate throug your directories with `cd` until you are in your previous created folder. Type in `git clone https://github.com/PatrickMagAnime/My-Osu-Songs-Folder.git`

**On Linux:** Go to your folder. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/PatrickMagAnime/My-Osu-Songs-Folder.git` idk why I am explaining this.

Now you are in the cloned folder, make sure you have changed the Songs folder name in your Osu! directory! On the end, copy the Songs folder from the cloned directory into your osu! directory. You need to start the game, press F5 to import all maps. Depending on your hardware, it will need 5-40 minutes with calculation.
